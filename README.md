# vanity-name-app
Composable finance solidity task

## Description
- See `contracts/VanityNameSystem.sol` for a full description of the implementation of the smart contract.
- After spending 4 hours on the base smart contract, I would call it complete, but untested. If I had further time
  I would have written an extensive suite of tests to ensure the contract is working as expected.
- Overall, the project was not hard, but did require a bit of thinking to architect correctly.

## Installation Requirements & Instructions
- Ensure you are using node v12 or higher. I use NVM for this.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run tests: `npx hardhat test` - except the tests are not yet written
